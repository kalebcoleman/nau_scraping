Fall 2025,2025-2026,CS,450,Parallel Programming,"Parallel computing is a widespread technology because of the invention of multi-core processors. For instance, many consumer electronics such as laptops, and smart phones contain multiple CPU cores that can be programmed to execute a program faster than only using a single core. Why do we care about CPU cores in smart phones and other modern computers? CPU clock speeds have become stagnant. Consequently, the number of processors packed onto a single chip continues to increase. No longer can an individual wait for a faster (e.g., higher clock speed) processor to be released to decrease the time it takes to run a program or to improve program responsiveness. Instead, computational resources need to be carefully exploited to reduce the time it takes to execute a program. Given the ubiquitous nature of multi-core computers, there is great demand for programmers that know how to exploit parallel architectures in industry, academia, and government labs. This course introduces students to parallel computing concepts in addition to a hands-on experience using key technologies and approaches used to program multi-core and many-core architectures. Students will learn about program optimization and performance evaluation for sequential and parallel programs. The hands-on approach is intended to ensure that students matriculating from the course will have the confidence needed to address the challenges of parallel computing in the real-world. Types of parallel programs that will be studied include shared-memory programs for the CPU and an introduction to programming the many-core GPU architecture. We will use NAU's cluster, Monsoon, for the GPU component of the course, heavily using the C programming language. Co convened with CS 550.

Consequently, the number of processors packed onto a single chip continues to increase. No longer can an individual wait for a faster (e.g., higher clock speed) processor to be released to decrease the time it takes to run a program or to improve program responsiveness.  Instead, computational resources need to be carefully exploited to reduce the time it takes to execute a program. Given the ubiquitous nature of multi-core computers, there is great demand for programmers that know how to exploit parallel architectures in industry, academia, and government labs. This course introduces students to parallel computing concepts in addition to a hands-on experience using key technologies and approaches used to program multi-core and many-core architectures. Students will learn about program optimization and performance evaluation for sequential and parallel programs.  The hands-on approach is intended to ensure that students matriculating from the course will have the confidence needed to address the challenges of parallel computing in the real-world. Types of parallel programs that will be studied include shared-memory programs for the CPU and an introduction to programming the many-core GPU architecture. We will use NAU's cluster, Monsoon, for the GPU component of the course, heavily using the C programming language. Co-convened with CS 450. Letter grade only.

You will also learn how to use value-chain emissions to identify the greatest GHG reduction opportunities across a company's entire value chain. Scope 3 emissions are indirect emissions that occur as a result of activities outside of an organization's own operations, but often represent its largest source of emissions. Quantifying Scope 3 emissions enables organizations to comprehensively manage their emissions-related risks and opportunities, and provides a more transparent and holistic account of their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions or impact. Therefore, understanding the sources of Scope 3 emissions can help an organization know where to focus its reduction efforts and is foundational to effective GHG mitigation and management. This is the third course in a series of four courses that satisfy the requirements for the Professional Certificate in Greenhouse Gas Accounting.

To reduce GHG emissions, corporations and institutions are adopting a variety of climate change and/or GHG mitigation goals. In order to do so, organizations need to be able to identify and select the most appropriate mitigation projects based on effectiveness, cost, return-on-investment, and other factors. They also need to assess and report progress toward their goals in a relevant, complete, transparent, and accurate manner that is consistent with accepted methodologies. Some mitigation goals can be achieved by a combination of emission reductions within the boundary of an organization and through purchased offsets provided via carbon markets.  All of these skills are necessary for designing effective mitigation projects for greenhouse gas emission reduction and this course teaches you those skills. Before you manage GHG emissions, however, you must quantify them. Therefore, this course builds off the foundational skills in GHG accounting introduced in the first three courses of the certificate and satisfies the final course requirement for the Professional Certificate in Greenhouse Gas Accounting.

Spring 2026,2025-2026,CLA,280,Classical Mythology,"Myth is a narrative form through which people within a particular culture establish and probe their shared sense of reality, identity, and relatedness. Many myths provide explanations for how things came to be the way they are at the time the story is told. Other myths explore human dependence on, and vulnerability to, the forces manifest in nature, which are typically personified as superhuman beings or forces. Other myths provide positive and negative examples of humanity in light of the values promoted within the particular society. Still other myths clearly have a primarily entertainment value, reveling in surprise, scandal, and comedy. In these ways, myth facilitates human exploration of meaning in life. The Classical mythology of Greece and Rome and the biblical stories of Judaism and Christianity did this in their original historical and regional contexts, and continue to do so in their long afterlife as part of the heritage of European and American culture. This course provides students with an exploration of how these stories address perennial human questions and concerns about a meaningful universe. This course will examine Greek and Roman classical myths and Jewish and Christian biblical stories that have frequently been represented in visual cultures over the centuries in Europe and beyond. When taught as part of a study abroad trip, the course will be customized to provide the literary background of the specific visual material students will view while abroad.

Spring 2026,2025-2026,CS,450,Parallel Programming,"Parallel computing is a widespread technology because of the invention of multi-core processors. For instance, many consumer electronics such as laptops, and smart phones contain multiple CPU cores that can be programmed to execute a program faster than only using a single core. Why do we care about CPU cores in smart phones and other modern computers? CPU clock speeds have become stagnant. Consequently, the number of processors packed onto a single chip continues to increase. No longer can an individual wait for a faster (e.g., higher clock speed) processor to be released to decrease the time it takes to run a program or to improve program responsiveness. Instead, computational resources need to be carefully exploited to reduce the time it takes to execute a program. Given the ubiquitous nature of multi-core computers, there is great demand for programmers that know how to exploit parallel architectures in industry, academia, and government labs. This course introduces students to parallel computing concepts in addition to a hands-on experience using key technologies and approaches used to program multi-core and many-core architectures. Students will learn about program optimization and performance evaluation for sequential and parallel programs. The hands-on approach is intended to ensure that students matriculating from the course will have the confidence needed to address the challenges of parallel computing in the real-world. Types of parallel programs that will be studied include shared-memory programs for the CPU and an introduction to programming the many-core GPU architecture. We will use NAU's cluster, Monsoon, for the GPU component of the course, heavily using the C programming language. Co convened with CS 550.

Spring 2026,2025-2026,CS,550,Parallel Programming,"Parallel computing is a widespread technology because of the invention of multi-core processors. For instance, many consumer electronics such as laptops, and smart phones contain multiple CPU cores that can be programmed to execute a program faster than only using a single core. Why do we care about CPU cores in smart phones and other modern computers? CPU clock speeds have become stagnant. Consequently, the number of processors packed onto a single chip continues to increase. No longer can an individual wait for a faster (e.g., higher clock speed) processor to be released to decrease the time it takes to run a program or to improve program responsiveness.  Instead, computational resources need to be carefully exploited to reduce the time it takes to execute a program. Given the ubiquitous nature of multi-core computers, there is great demand for programmers that know how to exploit parallel architectures in industry, academia, and government labs. This course introduces students to parallel computing concepts in addition to a hands-on experience using key technologies and approaches used to program multi-core and many-core architectures. Students will learn about program optimization and performance evaluation for sequential and parallel programs.  The hands-on approach is intended to ensure that students matriculating from the course will have the confidence needed to address the challenges of parallel computing in the real-world. Types of parallel programs that will be studied include shared-memory programs for the CPU and an introduction to programming the many-core GPU architecture. We will use NAU's cluster, Monsoon, for the GPU component of the course, heavily using the C programming language. Co-convened with CS 450. Letter grade only.
